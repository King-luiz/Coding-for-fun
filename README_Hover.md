# CSS Animated Buttons Project

This project demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS to create animated buttons with hover effects. Each button includes custom styles, animations, and text elements, providing an interactive and visually engaging user interface.

## Features

  - Four buttons with unique hover effects and animations.
  - Each button displays a platform name (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) and associated information.

- **Hover Animations:**

  - Smooth transitions and box shadows that activate when the user hovers over a button.
  - Dynamic changes to button appearance, including color, size, and shadows.

- **Custom Styling:**

  - Buttons are styled with gradients, shadows, and transitions for a sleek, modern look.
  - Text is positioned and styled with uppercase letters and custom letter spacing for better readability.

## Project Structure
